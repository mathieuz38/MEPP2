/**
 * \todo
 * CLEANME
 * The following test is a quest to find the minimum geometrical predicates
 * required in order to write the SRC/Filters without CGAL.
 * For example FEVV/Filters/normal.h currently uses CGAL::unit_normal()
 * which code (see the copy at the bottom of this file) assumes that the
 * "Mesh::Point" coordinates can be accessed through members x, y and z
 * i.e. one can write "Mesh::Point P; and then "auto a = p.x;".
 * But OpenMesh coordinate naming scheme uses the vector notation and
 * coordinate access is made through p[Ã˜), p[1] and p[2].
 * This is precisely the type of difficulty that Boost.Geometry tries to
 * avoid. For example the
 * [point concept of
 * Boost.Geometry"](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/concepts/concept_point.html)
 * should probably be a source of inspiration. In particular for its
 * abstraction (through traits) or coordinate access.
