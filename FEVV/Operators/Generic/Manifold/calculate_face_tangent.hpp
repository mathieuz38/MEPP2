  Any halfedge is fine, but assuming for example we're getting halfedge (named
  H) V2 -> V1, then points are as such:
    - V1 is the target of H
    - V2 is the source of H
    - V3 is the target of the next halfedge from H

  Actually, we don't care much about which points we get, as long as
  there are 3 of them linked to each other to deduce a plane from it
